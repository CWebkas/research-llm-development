Development with LLMs workshop

## Workshop info
**Title**

Development with Large Language Models

**Hosted by**

Mladen Fernežir
Co-founder and Lead Data Scientist, Velebit AI

**Short description**

We will use Google Colab and Kaggle Notebooks to go through some examples of what we can do with LLMs. We’ll cover OpenAI API usage and prompt engineering, and you’ll do your own parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning on custom data. You will also see how to use external knowledge and do retrieval augmented generation by using LangChain. Finally, you will showcase your LLM applications, such as chat, sentiment analysis, and summarization, as Hugging Face Space demos.

**Prerequisites (keywords)**

Your laptop, experience with Python and Jupyter notebooks, OpenAI API key, free Hugging Face account, free Kaggle account (requires phone verification for free GPU access)
